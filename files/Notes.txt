Spark V robot is based on ATMEGA16A microcontroller. 

Robot has 2x16 alphanumeric LCD

Motors are controlled by L293D motor driver. 

Robot gives top speed of 15cm to 20cm per second depending on the model.  

USB Communication using FT232 USB to Serial Converter

ATMEGA16 has 2 eight bit timers (timer 0 and 
timer 2) and 1 sixteen bit timer ( timer1). 

Velocity control – Timer 1 is used to gene
rate PWM for robot’s 
velocity control.  

The Timer/Counter can be clocked by an internal or an external clock source. 
The clock source  is  selected  by  the  Clock  Select  logic
which  is  controlled  by  the  Clock  Select  
CS12:0 bits located in the Timer/Counter control Register B (TCCR1B).
